1. Develop a VS Code Extension for Text Injection
Objective:
Create an extension that listens for new text from an external source and immediately inserts it into the active editor buffer.

How to Do It:

File Monitoring:
Have the extension watch a predetermined temporary file (for example, /tmp/inject.txt). When this file is updated, the extension reads its content.

Injection Logic:
Use VS Codeâ€™s editor API (e.g., editor.edit()) to insert the content at the current cursor position in the active text editor.

Optional Cleanup:
After a successful injection, clear the file or mark it as processed to avoid duplicate insertions.
